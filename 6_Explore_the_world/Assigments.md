# Assignment of Chapter 3rd

### 1. What is Microservices ?
<p> Microservices , also known as Micorservice architecture - that strucutres an application , which are loosely coupled , 
    independently deployable , which is built around different business capabilites and each service is managed by different small teams. The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably - a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world. </p>

### 2. What is Monolith Architecture ?
<p> A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. The word “monolith” is often attributed to something large and glacial, which isn’t far from the truth of a monolith architecture for software design. </p>

### 3. What is the difference b/w Monolith and Microservices ?
<ul>
    <li> Microservice is easy to maintain for large code base application </li>
    <li> Monolith is easy to develop</li>
    <li> Microservice is easy for delpoyment </li>
</ul>

### 4. Why do we need a useEffect Hook ?
<p> Whenver we want to render after fetching data. The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
useEffect( callback func. , dependency array )
For empty dep. array : it will be called once after rendering the initial UI component
With dep. array      : it will be called after rendering the initial UI component and after everytime the state changes.
</p>

### 5. What is optional Chaining ?
<p> The optional chaining (?.) operator is a way of accessing the objects properties i.e. functions and its data properties.
    It returns undefined or null , when the path mentioned or the function is not existent. This way is useful in error scenarios. Otherwise js code may give error like given variable name is undefined if variable name is not proper . Check MDN web docs for more information. 
</p>

### 6. What is Shimmer UI ?
<p> A shimmer UI resembles the page's actual UI, so users will understand how quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up. It gives people an idea of what's about to come and what's happening (it's currently loading) when a page full of content/data takes more than 3 - 5 seconds to load.
</p>

### 7. What is the difference b/w JS expressions and JS statement ?
### 8. What is conditional rendering, explain with code example ?
### 9. What is CORS ?
<p> CORS i.e. Cross Origin Resource sharing is the protocol for resource sharing b/w two system. It has three three steps 
    pre-flight call check , then conf. and finally actual request is made from source system to destination system.
</p>

### 10. What is async and await ?
### 11. What is the use of 'const json = await data.json();' ?
