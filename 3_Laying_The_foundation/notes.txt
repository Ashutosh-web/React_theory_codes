1. Difference b/w JSX and HTML ?
2. JSX is not HTML inside javascript : this is a wrong statement
3. What is babel ?

4. React Component
   // everything is a component in react
   // 4.1 : one is functional component - New Way of writing code : most of the time this will be used
   // 4.2 : one is Class based component - Old Way of writing code

5. Functional Component : is a funcationl only, that return a jsx / react element / or a component
   const Header = (props)=>{
   return (
   <>
   ...
   </>
   )
   }

6. React Component Vs REACT element : once a () is removed from funcational component it becomes a react element.
7. What is sanitisation ?
8. Component Composition ?

/**\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***/
H.W. : Do everything in your system.

1. We created script and build in package.json
2. Remove consol.log in our code base, we used the plugin
3. "last 2 version" : IT does not mean it will work only on chrome.
4. .babelrc
5. Key in React elements : React Tree Reconciliation key : Diff Algorithm
6. JSX : At the end of day is react.createelement which conversion happens from babel
7. Functional Component , root.render(<HeaderComponent />)
8. {} => we can write any piece of js inside JSX code
9. We can skip the return in Functional componnet : Kind of the shorthand
10. Difference b/w tree shaking vs clean coding
